  This is 'public_html/index.html' for an EECS course.
  Please do not modify it.
  It is re-created automatically by the script /home/aa/staff/inst/bin/archive-websites.pl.
  It redirects either to the current WEB site or to ./archives.html.

  The course WEB sites must be installed in subdirectories that have
  a standard 4-char lowercase name such as fa04, su04 or sp05.

  Instructors, for course WEB site requirements and guidelines please see
